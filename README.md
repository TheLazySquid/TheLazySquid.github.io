I'll put random stuff here.

### Pages

There's two useful pages: [gimCreator](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimCreator), which is a tool for making custom Gims for Gimkit, and [gimRenderer](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimRenderer), which is a tool for rendering the animations of official Gims.
